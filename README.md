# JavaFXApplicationAutoUpdater

  Let's say you have a Java Application . You want to distribute it to your users right ? Yep !
  But you also want every time you release a new update for your application , that update to be automatically downloaded and update your application version.

  Well here you are! I have created this small application which does exactly this . Updates your application version .

 

# How it works?

 Basically i have written this code for an application called [XR3Player](https://github.com/goxr3plus/XR3Player).
 Every once a while i am releasing an update for XR3Player in the format of a zip folder called [for example [XR3Player Update 70.zip]](https://github.com/goxr3plus/XR3Player/releases)

 The Updater downloads this zip folder , extracts it and after that it starts the main application which is XR3Player.
